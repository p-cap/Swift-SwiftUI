Embed the current ViewController into a NavigationController

insert 3 butttons with a size of 200 x 100

Go to the size inspector to adjust Y position of the butttons

CTRL drag from the buttons to see the following options for auto layout

Uitlize choose “Top Space to Safe Area“ and "Center Horizontally in Safe Area.”

Drag the flag images onto Assets.xcassets

iOS looks for the  dragged images that are for retina display and non-retina display

Insrt an image inside the button using the attribute inspector

When aligning images, utilize the ctrl drag option to align to the elemnents above or below

Resolve Auto Layout Issue > Update Frames

---> Interface Builder is responsible for the attributes of the button and stuff

Create IBOutletes for 3 of the buttons 

Declare a countries array and assign inside the viewdidload

create a function that statically assign the buttons with images (UIImage)

and call the function inside viewdidload

  --> UIView 
      --> UIButton
      --> UIView
      --> CALayer

adding border to the button but the syntax below DOES NOT WORK
//        button1.layer.borderColor = UIColor.lightGray.cgColor
//        button2.layer.borderColor = UIColor.lightGray.cgColor
//        button3.layer.borderColor = UIColor.lightGray.cgColor

use the shuffle method to randomize the array

and then, have a correct answer variable to randomize the numbers

The correct answer now becomes the title of the page

Create an IBAction function and connect all three buttons to the same IBAction function


NOTE: The difference between @IBOutlet and @IBAction 
--> @IBAction is a way making storyboard layouts trigger code
--> @IBOutlet is a away of connecting code to storyboard layouts

Assign tags to each button via attributes inspector 

Compare sender tag to the correct answer
